🍔 Bacon Cheeseburger Meatloaf Recipe
# Ingredients:
## For the Meatloaf:

- [ ]    1 ½ lbs ground beef (80/20 or 85/15)

- [ ]    6 slices cooked bacon, chopped

- [ ]    1 cup shredded cheddar cheese

- [ ]    1 small onion, finely chopped

- [ ]    2 cloves garlic, minced

- [ ]    ½ cup breadcrumbs

- [ ]    2 eggs

- [ ]    ¼ cup ketchup

- [ ]    2 tbsp yellow mustard

- [ ]    1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce

- [ ]    ½ tsp salt

- [ ]    ½ tsp black pepper

- [ ]    1 tbsp pickle relish (optional – adds a cheeseburger vibe)

## For the Topping:

    2 tbsp ketchup

    1 tbsp yellow mustard

    ½ tbsp brown sugar (optional – for a sweet tangy glaze)

    Extra shredded cheddar cheese (for top)

## Instructions:
1. Preheat Oven:

    Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).

2. Cook Bacon:

    Cook bacon in a skillet until crisp. Drain on paper towels, then chop into small pieces.

3. Mix Meatloaf:

    In a large bowl, combine:

        Ground beef

        Chopped cooked bacon

        Shredded cheese

        Onion

        Garlic

        Breadcrumbs

        Eggs

        Ketchup

        Mustard

        Worcestershire sauce

        Salt & pepper

        Pickle relish (if using)

    Mix just until combined—don’t overmix or the loaf may become tough.

4. Shape and Place:

    Form the mixture into a loaf shape and place on a lined baking sheet or in a loaf pan (leave some space on the sides if using a pan to allow for even cooking).

5. Add Topping:

    In a small bowl, mix together the ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar.

    Spread evenly over the top of the meatloaf.

6. Bake:

    Bake for 50–60 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 160°F (71°C).

7. Final Cheese Topping:

    In the last 5 minutes of baking, sprinkle extra shredded cheddar on top and return to the oven to melt.

8. Rest and Serve:

    Let the meatloaf rest for 10 minutes before slicing. This helps retain juices.

## Serving Suggestions:

    Serve with mashed potatoes, roasted vegetables, or even on toasted buns for the ultimate meatloaf sandwich.

    Add pickles and extra ketchup on the side for a real cheeseburger feel!
